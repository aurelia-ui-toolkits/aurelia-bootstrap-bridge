### 1. Introduction
<br>

In this set of tutorials we are focusing on the Aurelia plugin components of this application (explained with more details in the **[About this application - Introduction page](#/help/docs/about_this_application/1._introduction)**). Starting with the standard **[Aurelia Skeleton plugin](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-plugin)** project, we will follow the same "story" that starts in the **[Application developers tutorials](#/help/docs/app_developers_tutorials/1._introduction)** from a ***different prospective*** - a viewpoint of the Aurelia plugin developer.
<br>

In other words, this article presents the **overview** of the ways to create and extend the **[Aurelia-KendoUI-Plugin](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-plugin)** project developed by the team of Aurelia UI Toolkits organization, dedicated to contribute to Aurelia's wide spread adoption. Just like the App developers tutorials start with the Aurelia Skeleton Navigation and add several Aurelia-KendoUI components assuming that these components are already available, this set of tutorials show how this initial set of components was created, starting with the **["empty plugin"](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-plugin)**
<br>

The note **[Bridge utilities](#/help/docs/bridge_developers_notes/2._bridge_utilities)** is not a "direct" part of this set of tutorials - it describes the several utilities developed by the Aurelia UI Toolkits team to make the process of building Aurelia plugins easier. The same explanation holds for the other notes in the **Bridge developers notes**

#### Important notes

All subsequent tutorials assume that you used the **HAVING KENDOUI ALREADY: VENDORS** approach described  on the **[Help on Installation](#/help/docs/about_this_application/5._installation)** page.
<br>

The whole section named **Bridge developers tutorials** is intended solely to new bridge projects contributors - a lot narrower class than people interested **App developers tutorials** dedicated to all Aurelia application developers that want to use KendoUI components provided by the Aurelia-KendoUI bridge.
