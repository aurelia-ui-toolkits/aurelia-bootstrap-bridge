### 5. Installation
<br>

The **[Installation page](#/installation)** contains very detailed description of all three installation variants which depend on how do you plan to get **[KendoUI product](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui)** from Telerik.
<br>

You could already have the KendoUI PRO license, or you plan to download the KendoUI PRO evaluation copy - in both such cases you should select the HAVING KENDOUI ALREADY: VENDORS tab which provides all details of the approach where KendoUI is kept in the `vendors` folder in you project.

The other two alternatives are variants of the same idea - grab the free copy of a free subset of KendoUI controls set, often referred to as Kendo core. If you want to take the **[Github route](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-core)**, select the NEW FROM GITHUB: KENDO CORE tab. The last alternative described in NEW FROM GITHUB: JSPM-GIT tab handles the case where you want to fetch KendoUI core from **[Telerik's website using bower](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/intro/installation/bower-install#install-bower-packages)**
