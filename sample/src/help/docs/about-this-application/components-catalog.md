### 3. Catalog of KendoUI controls as Aurelia components.
<br>
This is the most likely fashion this application is being used. Invoked via URL: **<a href="http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo">http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo</a>** the application renders the view shown below, which shows the likely most interesting control **grid** by default.

#### 2.1 Browsing the catalog

The click on **Samples** menu item (as shown on Image 1 above) results with the Aurelia KendoUI Controls Catalog "landing" (default) page which depicts the KendoUI basic grid sample (again as shown on Image 1 above). In addition to rendering the grid, the Aurelia KendoUI Controls Catalog also shows the **Samples Toolbar**, which shows all categories of controls, with the **MOST POPULAR** category being select as default. At the moment, this category has only grid control selected as its own default - which explains why is the click on that category results with the same view as it is rendered initially

Selecting other items from the Samples Toolbar will result with the appearance of the second instance of the Samples Toolbar, right beneath the first one. Here is the the screenshot of the application state if the **MOST POPULAR** toolbar item is selected:

Finally, selecting the **STOCK CHARTS** toolbar item, results with the the view of the stock charts page of this catalog:

#### 2.2 Browsing the catalog's code sections
<br>
Each of the page showing a KendoUI control converted to an Aurelia component, has the section that shows the component's **view** and **view model**. Here are three consecutive screen-shots showing that information for the Sample grid control on **Image 1** above.
<br>

**Grid view**
